| Jan 15 | 12:45-1:15 |                                                                                             I am going about an algorithm of n^2 complexity, which loops through each index before it and finds the max run of a number that it less than the current number. Then simply add one to it. I am running into a bug though right now. |
| Jan 15 | 1:15-1:45  |                                                                                                                                                                                   I was able to pass all the checks! I was dealing with a bug, but my issue came from breaking early in my for loop instead of writing 'continue.' |
| Jan 15 | 4:30-5:00  |                                                                                                                                                                 I brainstormed for 30 minutes speedups to my solution that could lower the n^2 complexity, including arraylists and maps but I wasn't able to think of a solution. |
| Jan 19 | 7:45-8:15  |                    I spent this time coding out the main function, creating my adjacency list in O(n^2) complexity. I also began creating my recursive method, using memoization for a speedup. I need to finish my recursive function and then code the logic in my main method for calling the recursive method for each vertex. |
| Jan 21 | 1:50-2:20  | I spent this time finishing my main function which calls my recursive method and keeping track of the longest total path. I also continued by adding comments, and implementing a map of path lengths for efficient lookups (and not exponential time complexity). My efficient large is still too long though and gets timed out. |
| Jan 22 | 9:20-9:50  |                                        I spent this time trying to optimize my recursive function so that the longest test runs in time. I made my code more fluent by updating my current vertex at the end of my recursive function, as opposed to updating all the length to all my adjacent vertices in my recursive function. |
