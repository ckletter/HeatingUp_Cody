Then simply add one to it. I am running into a bug though right now. |

I was dealing with a bug, but my issue came from breaking early in my for loop instead of writing 'continue.' |
| Jan 15 | 4:30-5:00  |                                                                                                                                              I brainstormed for 30 minutes speedups to my solution that could lower the n^2 complexity, including arraylists and maps but I wasn't able to think of a solution. |
| Jan 19 | 7:45-8:15  | I spent this time coding out the main function, creating my adjacency list in O(n^2) complexity. I also began creating my recursive method, using memoization for a speedup. I need to finish my recursive function and then code the logic in my main method for calling the recursive method for each vertex. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
